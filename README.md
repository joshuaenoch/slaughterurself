5 second countdown fix
- 5 second countdown is good for before the workout starts, but during the workout, the 5 second countdown should not add 5 seconds to the workout, it should overlap with the current timer. basically, once the current timer hits 5 seconds, the 5 second count down should appear. let's make the 5 second countdown timer during the workout only appear if the show timer option is disabled as well. again, the 5 second countdown before the workout is good, do not change anything about it, just during the workout
- let's also make it not overlap the entire screen, let's just make it a red number in the middle of the screen (did not check this but all the other buttons should still accessible)
Workout UI
- the timer and the workout list should both be on the right side of the screen with their toggle buttons underneath where they appear
General UI
- no color needed, i will implement that later, so make it black, white, and grey for now

Later, ignore these edits for now
disable round numnbers in the decimal
